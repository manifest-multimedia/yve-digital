YVE Digital's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how YVE Digital's visitors use its website. From time to time, YVE Digital may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>YVE Digital also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://yvedigital.com blog posts.
